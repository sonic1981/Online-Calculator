## Required frameworks

To run this application you will need to have a working copy of node.js installed. [See here for installation instructions](https://nodejs.org/en/).

To check if you have a working copy of node open a command line interface ([Mac](https://www.alphr.com/open-command-prompt-mac/) and [Windows](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Command_Prompt/Open)) and type:

```bash
node -v
```

You should see something that looks like:

```

## Running the app

- Once you have a working copy of node open up a command prompt in the root of this folder
- Run the following commands in the prompt opened above
  - `npm install`
  - `npm run start`

This will open up your browser and start the web app.
